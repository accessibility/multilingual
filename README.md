# Multilingual Accessibility
Most of the resources on accessibility are English. This is a real problem for adoption. We need betters support in other languages to see that we are able to help support people with disabilities in the language that is most effective for them. 

This could be a matter of simply having access to WCAG 2.0 in French or it could be about having access to plain language tools developed for other languages.  This is just an informal list of things that are useful when trying to support people in a non-English context.
